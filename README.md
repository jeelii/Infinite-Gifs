- Your searches are saved in the browser

## Demo

ðŸš€ [Launch website](https://jeelii.github.io/Infinite-Gifs/)
If it stops loading gifs, it can be because the Giphy API (beta version) is limited to a certain number of requests in a limited time (I print this error on the page if that is the case). You can come back and try again in a little while.
